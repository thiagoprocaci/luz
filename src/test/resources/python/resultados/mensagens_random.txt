 Java handles addresses itself so you don't have to!
 
the user has to give the input first and then it goes for validation, for giving the input he might have given some text field and also a corresponding ok button (if he wishes to) and when the user hits on enter in the text field or click on the button, then the validation should start, so better add a keylistener to the text field and when user presses enter, call the validate. that's it!
 
what are possible? how could it be possible? where do the info come from? who will write it? how will they write it?
 
Get data from the database and then new JRadioButton by passing the field name to JRadioButton constructor's parameter.

you'll have to say it in clarity, the guy has come up with a doubt and you'll need to solve it! how can you misguide him?
 
haha! ok!
 
@Hans Brinkhof: 10th Position if counted from 0. Anyways thanks for the Grammar.
 
Thanks for all. Code is updated. You guys give worthy comments, but why don't some do it politely? -_-
 
Because sir James Gosling like it!
 
JSP is easier to code and also efficient for writing the presentation logic, even in the struts http://java-demos.blogspot.com
 
He is saying about drag-and-drop option, the pre-generated source code i think so and not about creating GUI by programmers own code!
 
it is 2d not 3d!, the array
 
Ashwin Singh, Yes, thanks for the comment. Just take time to look at the last heading, this is even more simple, well Sachin Hegde, if you just take time to look at the last heading that is just at the cost of a method call, whatever if you don't laugh for it! o.O  :P
 
use excelsior jet
 
Pointers is a rock solid concept in C yet!
 
strange! Is Sachin Hegde a help vampire?
 
i said to see the last heading in the page!
 
The user has to give the input first, and how will he give without an form of GUI/CUI?
 
NetBeans is pretty good for GUI, i've been using it since a long time.
 
Hans Brinkhof a jar file contains java classes and not javascript classes!
 
nothing happens if we advertise free apps!!
 
You're right comparing kills!

Sharad Gautamuse winrar to extract jar file
 
o.O
 
Sachin Hegde Common, he helped me with Grammar, just see the top comment, ;) It is not for fun, he corrected me!
 
Better start learning with Notepad first and then go for NetBeans IDE
 
Hans Brinkhof You cannot say that they are incorrent, but that looked quite lengthy, and a simple way is suggested, later. All the programs worked fine for me, and after all has happened, i will post them!
 
Could any same the logic for finding text in a textarea and selecting it. Like, i want the logic for Find in Notepad
 
ok, how can i read from it unless something is written into it?
 
i've read all those, how will you let an user directly write into a file and from where does he write? do you manually keep adding the records in the program itself or what?
 
You will first need to understand about the core concepts of the database and then, see the security issues, the way the databases store the data, handling users, networking, extending database in the harddisk and over the network, write driver classes, support ORM frameworks, get SQL license from IBM. After all this was done, now think about how to code it, it really requires millions of code lines for sure.
 
how is the info written into the file? through java application?
 
Hans Brinkhof Are you the admin of this group? If so, can you rename the group as "Java And Grammar!" ;)
 
:)
 
Fine i will update it and thanks, but did you note the StringTokenizer?

 If you want the traditional Oracle JDK, I don't believe there is a "quick" way to install it. You'll have to download the binary, change permissions on it, run it in the right location and do an update-alternatives. Instructions for that are in that link above, which also has another link to instructions specifically for 12.04.
 
I don't think Ubuntu supports the Oracle JDK in package form anymore. You'll have to do it manually, unless you want the OpenJDK. I use JRockit myself :) This page should give you all the info you need - https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Java
 
I like these two: http://www.hunlock.com/blogs/Essential_Javascript_--_A_Javascript_Tutorial
 
http://docstore.mik.ua/orelly/java-ent/jenut/index.htm (kind of old though...)
 
I'm partial to JDeveloper's diagramming tools. But of course it's a whole IDE so it's a bit overkill!
 
Not sure if it is what you want... I've never done it before. But could you use iText? There is a community edition of iText available. And I found some tutorials online. http://www.vaannila.com/struts/struts-example/struts-display-tag-example-1.html
 
http://www.learn-javascript-tutorial.com/
 
Just to mention them, there's also Oracle's JDeveloper and Intellij IDEA as well. IDEA has a commercial version and free version. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_integrated_development_environments#Java

 They're not quite the same ...

String s = "Hello World" ;

This is a string literal (primative) and is stored in the string pool in the JVM, so if you then did:

String s2 = "Hello World";

"s" and "s2" would be exactly the same reference (s == s2 is true).
However ... if you do this:

String s3 = new String("Hello World");
String s4 = new String("Hello World");

This will create a string object stored in the heap as opposed to the string pool, so in this case (s3 == s4 is false) and will use twice the memory as "s" & "s1" - you could resolve this by "interning" s3 & s4:

s3 = s3.intern(); 
s4 = s4.intern();

then s3 & s3 would be the same object reference as "s" & "s1" and the old s3 & s4 objects would be GC'd (so long as no other references exist) ... However intern() is an expensive call so should be used sparingly ...
 
The problem with the image posted is that it highlights how shallow the media is (and how this can influence us ...) Both Jobs & Ritchie made major contributions to the technology arena which have have affected us all... I think the picture says more about the media than either Jobs or Ritchie... If you speak to anyone working with computers, programming, etc Ritchie is far from ignored! I wonder how we'll feel when Gosling passes on! :)

BTW I Love TeX much more fun than M$ Word, etc - wrote my whole masters dissertation using Leslie Lamport's  LaTeX.
 
Marshal Currier - well put! :) I fear Android will potentially suffer in the same way...
 
If you have a "Parent" class that you want to be able to subclass (forcing child classes to override certain methods) & also instantiate, there's no simple way to do this....

I'd create an "AbstractParent" if you like, then make the "Parent" a simple shell which more or less just calls "super.whateverMethod(...)" wherever it needs to.

Then you can just subclass "AbstractParent" for other implementations...

I know it's another class & you have to create a shell class... but I think it makes your intentions more clear to others - having a base class as abstract is a good warning later on that the class is used elsewhere & you need to take care with changes! :) I don't see maintenance as a significant issue....
 
It depends ... I did my masters in image processing & the course was geared up for C programming & we wrote most of the functions from the ground up... being contrary I chose to use java - this was in '96, so I was using Java ~0.9! pre JIT, Hotspot :)

It worked fine for me if a little slow - I was able to do FFT, Hough Transforms, Gaussian blur, etc

I've not used Matlab, so I'm not to familiar with it & the Graphics 2D package in Java may not have everything you want ... but if you want to write your own functions, Java is quite capable.
 
Well, I hope Android keeps up the momentum, Motorola Mobility may well give it the ability to compete with Apple head-to-head :)

Perhaps we need a Google endorsed/based Linux distro.... (please don't mention Chrome OS!)
 
Two objects can have the same hashcode, equals is used to make matches - the contract between equals() & hashcode() is :

if two objects are "equal" they must have equal hashcodes, however, if two objects have equal hashcodes they aren't necessarily "equal"

hashcode comes into play mainly with HashMap, Hashtable, HashSet (this is actually backed by a HashMap) - properly implemented hashcode & equals() gives fastest lookup in such maps.
 
To answer the initial question assuming you're lookup up the objects from a Map....

HashMap stores items in an array of Lists with the hashcode forming the index of the array, so to find two objects will result in a O(1) lookup for the list followed by at most a O(n) lookup followed by an O(n-1) lookup for the two objects. (n being the number of objects with the same hashcode)

If they had unique hashcodes it would be two O(1) lookups (much faster)
 
Java primitives aren't thread safe

c+=1 is the same as c = c + 1

so if both threads see c as initially 0, then they'll both add one and the result will be 

"Finished Finished 1" 

It's probably more rare than the other cases, though similar in likelihood to seeing "Finished Finished 2"

 for example if one has several variables (ex. Sting one , String two , String three) and he should compare this vaiables each in a methode that have a String
( ex : public boolean match(String str) ) with that String str is this anyway to make it 
shorter than that one writes ( if ( one > str) .. if ( two > str) ... if ( three > str ) ...) so my question is how can one make that shorter ? und thanks
 
so return fragment;
 
cann anyone with Help   with this exercise:   /**
  * Splits the Fragment into two at the position of the cursor and returns
  * the newly generated right Fragment.
  *
  * This method extracts the substring at (position,length) from this
  * FragementCursor's Fragment and returns a new Fragment which contains that
  * substring and uses a copy of the old fragment's style.
  *
  * After executing this method, the Fragment this cursor points to 
  * is shortened up to the position of the FragmentCursor, 
  * the cursor still points to the position after the last character in the fragment. 
  * 
  * MUST NOT PRODUCE EMPTY FRAGMENTS:
  * If the the current position is at the beginning or end of the current fragment, 
  * a split would produce an empty fragment. 
  * This is not allowed, so the caller must ensure that these preconditions hold. 
  * The method checks if the preconditions are met and aborts otherwise. 
  *
  * @return The newly generated right Fragment.

i asking for why only the ActionPerformed event working with Scanner and others don't !
 
yup i know these events to my keyboard but ActionPerformed need pressing " Enter " to work .. when using Scanner it working without pressing anything
 
I'm taking about Scanner Device not Scanner I/o ! Walter William Milner
 
Hans Brinkhof eeeehm but what about ActionPerformed we need to handle keyboard event to work ... when i'm using ActionPerformed with the scanner device the event worked as keyReleased
 
why Scanner ( Device read bar code ) typing event is ActionPerformed and not working with keys event such as keyPressed , keyReleased and keyTyped ?!

:/ group rules don't say that we should not ask for help if we need a code, second if i have the answer sure i give him what he needs , third i agree  with u it is better to close it !
 
if u r using windows there is a plug in that show u that
 
loool why u r answering him like this ????? he needs the code and he is here asking for help that is simple
 
please did any one here work in 'brain computer interface' ?
 
Erle nd Angel , u can c the groupe rules , we can ask about php,c and all programming language c that on the rules :)
 
hi , please is there any a tool to know the algorithm used for a sequence of numbers  ?
for exemple if i have this sequence 
903520
845215
554244
517381
360965
i have to know the next numbers
 
No i  don't need informations but i need someone who worked in a lab about that
 
it is not the case, thanks for ur help all of u :)
 
these are identifiers of files. they are auto_increment, they have no relationship with time, I'm guessing the other identifiers in order to access the requested files
 
Hello , please who is working here in ICM "interface brain machine" ?
 
yes james thanks ^_^ i'll look there
 
yes James, that's what I am trying to do, find the next
 
Yes we can give the concept to feed him for a life :)
 
that is Interface Computer Machine , means how to controle electronique devices using just signal of brain
 
any person who has the number of the file can see it, i'll try again to guess it
 
the length of numbers that i have is 7 , how can i guess the probability by my brain :/ ? thanks for this suggestion
 
no Sandeep :p I'm steel cheking it , and i c the code of Jacek :)
 
no it is not likely, because even if you create an empty file system gives it an identifier, so it has no relationship with the contained
 
same thing with $PARAMS
 
yes, I'm now looking about how can i make the difference between signals of brain , means signals that  the user's brain product to do the action he wants and if he is at the same time thinking in other things it will also generate brain signals

 Perhaps take a look at JNI too.
 
Also, a lot of these questions are stupid and do nothing more than a college-level exam could. If an interviewer tried to just test my knowledge of Java instead of my knowledge in topics that actually require thought (and not a simple google query), I would consider the job a lot more stupid than one that actually asks me an insightful question.
 
Interesting enough. Can you detail more the algorithms you've used to handle input and output? I've written an algorithm that does something like this, and I was wondering if you had done anything different than I did.
 
Well, simply, I have a rudimentary algorithm design written here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_LHcoZLvN52aKfkbrhLSqKISbEcvI0DqJCwGlHawE9Q/edit?pli=1
What I want to know is, I guess in pseudocode, how yours works?
 
Folks, google exists for a reason. Please, please, use it.
 
... So why can't you read it normally?
 
Then learn how to apply SQL to Java. Then learn how to do scripting in Java, with as many languages as possible (Ruby, Python, Javascript, Lua, etc etc). The more you can apply and link together, the more you will inevitably learn.
 
Well, the algorithm by which it stores and retrieves the data to form sentences would be a place to start.

use simple window.location javascript function ..... pass any flag to indicate that page is already refreshed by your function or not
 
u r ri8 in all cases .. but no idea about method to check for number of objects
 
1. do some of whole array and divide it by 2 .. start iterating array element from start and do some of them untill the sum come closer to totalsum/2
 
k m getting null in output of 2nd sysout ..... it is beacuse of hashcode method of demo2 so how to solve it ?
 
you cant extends final class ... that break oo concept .... so not purely oo
 
HashMap<Key , Object> h = new HashMap<Key , Object>();
Key k = new Key();
h.add(k,new Object());

it will pass just reference of k as a key or a new  clone of k as key ?????
 
yeah m also telling same so for A a = new B() total 2 obj will be created on heap .. 1 is of class B and another one is of class A .... that can be refer by super keyword
 
i want something like if i change the value of i in key, the object  would also transfer to the appreciate bucket using i value , so in future it vl be possible to find that object using key ... but i hv no idea how to do this

can anyone solve this?

Write a program that reads in an integer and breaks it into a sequence of individual 
digits. For example the input 1234 is displayed as 1 2 3 4.

Thanks for advice Cedric Memo i will remember ur words..........
 
(1)

A student=new A();
can anyone explain the line given above.I want to know every detail of this 
line where is creating an object and which words are responsible for creating 
object.I also want to know what the difference between reference ID and
Object.

(2)

class A 
{
 int val1,val2;
 void A()
 {
 System.out.println("Hello ");
 }
 public static void main(String args[])
 {
 new A().A();
 }
}

What is the meaning of "new A().A()"
and in the above code are we return 
a value from the CONSTRUCTOR?

THANKS IN ADVANCE.....
 
Thanks for advice Atul Anand ........I was also first thinking that it can be solve by this way.
 
Hans Brinkhof i think here u r wrong a reference id exist......i think this is the id of Address in the RAM of the space which is created using new operator
 
Ken Bagnall u mean in the line "new A().doStuff();"creating the object??then why we need a reference ??

Hans Brinkhof: Means What..??
 
Okey Chris Pitschmann i will Work On that... :)

 Well can u please let us know the kind of problem u r facing? Compilation Error, Run time error or what do u want to do exactly...?
 
As far as my concerned, i found 3 errors in your code:1- Enum can't be subclassed.   2-in the line [return (Ajay)Enum.valueOf(ajay,a} ]where ajay comes from? and u did not close your parenthesis.   3-In the line super(s1,i), since Enum cannot be subclassed the keyword super with 2 args is referenced from nothing so it will obviously show an error.                       We don't know what u want to do actually, We usually use Enum to create constant variables that we can call any time. I don't see why u r trying to extend Enum?
 
True.......
 
Hello everybody, Is it possible to use inheritance with servlets without using java beans and hibernate?
 
Hello everybody, is somebody having the dumps of java 310-065?
 
//Hey guys let us have fun can anyone give me the ouput of the following?
enum HighVal {
Big(10),medium(5),small(1);
HighVal(int val){
 this.val = val;
}
private int val;
int getVal(){
return this.val;
}
}
class DispVal
 {
HighVal h1,h2,h3;
  public static void main(String[] args){
         new DispVal().h1 = HighVal.Big;       
         new DispVal().h2 = HighVal.medium;
         new DispVal().h3 = HighVal.small;
for (HighVal ha : HighVal.values())
          System.out.println(ha + " = " +ha.getVal());
      }
}
 
Of course... But what i meant was the question on the possibility to inherit servlets classes   ex: " class A extends HttpServlet and class B extends class A ".
 
Did u compile it or figured it out yourself?

 Chris Pitschmann using LOCAL still not a solution.. have tried
 
Falling Leaf why is it the i cant call session.setUsername.?
 
anyone?
 
I can't find some information about it when i tried to search. Do u have any reference..?
 
can you teach me how please..
 
Hello Java Community!

How can you call a function from the different package?
I have function called refreshAreaList(); in the StudentPanel and I want to call refreshAreaList() to another Class named FileImport.
 
sorry.. what i mean is, how many percent of chance will the data can be pick when using random in java?
 
i already tried dataentries.setText(rs.getString("BorrowedID")); but then I get this error "column BorrowedID is nt found.
 
How can you upload a txt file containing the names and section separated by a comma (,) into the database?
 
I want to get the username who logged in.. So what I did is, use gettxt in the login interface.. but my question is, how could i pass the value of my gettxt into another inteface.. Im using netbeans btw.
 
in the link u give. where is random scheduling?
 
try running a Linux OS. then see if ur hard drive is appearing.. if yes, u can backup ur files ..
 
its also public.. how can I call it from another package?
 
Good Afternoon friends.!
I have this GUI uploaded below. Is there a way that the JTabbedPane and JScrollPane be only visbile when i click File>Load Window?
 
seriously, I really cant find an elaborative explanation of this random scheduling algorithm. can u please help me..
 
Why cant I do this? "dataentries.setText(rs);"

This is the code:
 public void DataEntries(){
        String sql = "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM borrowed;";
        try{
            pst = connection.prepareStatement(sql);
            rs = pst.executeQuery(sql);
            dataentries.setText(rs);
        }
        catch (Exception e){
            JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null, e);
        }
    }
 
solved by making a new instance of a class..
 
do you mean how to create a package on netbeans?
 
yes.. the probability...
 
can you link me in its definition? since I cant find its definition and processes..
 
this is my class user: http://justpaste.it/25r8
and this is my JFrame for login: http://justpaste.it/25r9
 
still no good.. "SELECT COUNT(BorrowedID) FROM borrowed";
 
Why is it when i load a txt file and display the it on the list box, its not appearing even i call the refresh function i've made. It only appears if I will rerun the project.
But if I add it manually and by individual, it automatically display.
 
Is there a such algorithm called Random Scheduling Algorithm..?
 
because I need to use jFileChooser..
 
yes, my function is declared as public..
 
thanks..
 
i hve tried public static void setUsername(String loggedInUsername) {
        username = loggedInUsername;

bu error is cnnot be referenced from a static ontxt
 
thanks guys..
 
I have this login interface for user who will logged in to use the program. So what i wanted is that to take that username being used and output in another MainFrame Interface on who is logged in..
 
Have tried it.. but I get java.sql.SQLException: Before start of result set
 
newly fresh graduates are allowed to apply?
 
I have a menu that upload csv file into database. This is the code: http://pastebin.com/ZJAKWuGv

But then if I try to load it. I got error saying "java.sql.SQLException: File 'C:\ProgramData\MySQL\MySQL Server 5.5\data\UsersEdDocumentsest.csv' not found (Errcode:22)
 
or an algorithm perhaps..
 
Considering that I have a list of students to be inputted. And I have 3 groups. Each group will be distributed to different area and also time. So I have used random class in java to distribute students on different groups. My question is, is there any kind of scheduling technique similar to the process?
 
i will post it here..  
private void jMenuItem1ActionPerformed(java.awt.event.ActionEvent evt) {

// TODO add your handling code here:

Statement stmt;
String query;

try
{
Class.forName("com.mysql.jdbc.Driver");
Connection conn = (Connection) DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/rle_schedule", "root", "mysql");

stmt = (Statement) conn.createStatement(ResultSet.TYPE_SCROLL_SENSITIVE,ResultSet.CONCUR_UPDATABLE);

JFileChooser file_chooser = new JFileChooser();

FileNameExtensionFilter filter = new FileNameExtensionFilter("csv", "csv");

file_chooser.setFileFilter(filter);
int users_value = file_chooser.showOpenDialog(file_chooser);
if (users_value == JFileChooser.APPROVE_OPTION) {
File filee = file_chooser.getSelectedFile();
//FileInputStream fin = new FileInputStream(filee);

String pathone=filee.getPath();
//String Pathtwo="C:/Users/read/Desktop/data.csv";

query = "LOAD DATA INFILE '"+pathone+"' INTO TABLE student  FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' (id_number,name,sec_id)";

stmt.executeUpdate(query);

JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null, "Successfully Stored From Excel TO MySQL");
}
}
catch(Exception r)
{
JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null, r);
System.out.println(r);
}
}
 
anything can I do with it..?
 
What is the probability that class random in java will repeat its value?
 
In using Random in java, how can you calculate the percentage rate of date being chosen?
 
yes I am adding csv data into the database..
 
aside from distributing students on every group, the group will be scheduled on where they will be assigned and what time is their duty..
 
solved.. i need to add rs.next();
 
but if i pass the path as String it working well..
 
thanks. i have 1 last question:
IF i have nextInt(50) does it means it can generate 50 random number? or its 2^50?
 
yeah ur right Hans Brinkhof. i have two Jframes. the login jframe, and interface jframe.
 
I have tried to print the path using:
System.out.println(pathone);

it gives me the correct path:
C:\Users\Ed\Documents\test.csv
 
Does anyone knows any algorithm that is the same with Random in java?
Any algorithm that performs random.

 There is nothing special about developing cloud apps in java. 
==

Although, cloud app is too general of a concept. If you are thinking something in terms of distributed processing of information/tasks/or whatever else you want to achieve, you can check out hadoop. Hadoop is though implementation (among other things) of a very popular set of algorithms in computer science - Map/Reduce (Google for it)

== 
There are a lot of cloud app platforms as well. Some examples include http://www.heroku.com/ and Google App engine (https://developers.google.com/appengine/)
